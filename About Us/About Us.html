                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>At Cab Share, we believe that the journey is just as important as the destination. Our platform is designed to connect students who are traveling from one place to another, helping them find travel companions to share a cab with. Whether you're heading to the airport, visiting a new city, or simply commuting to a nearby town, Cab Share makes it easy to split the cost and enjoy the ride with fellow students.</p>
                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <p>Cab Share is simple and user-friendly. Students post their travel plans, including their departure time, destination, and any other relevant details. Other students who are traveling along the same route can then connect with them and share a cab. It's a great way to save money, reduce your carbon footprint, and make new friends along the way.</p>
